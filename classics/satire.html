The Importance of Being Earnest by
  Oscar Wilde
 (1895)

<p class="summary-box">The Importance of Being Earnest is a comedic play by Oscar Wilde that lampoons the societal norms and expectations of the Victorian era. The play follows the misadventures of two young gentlemen, Algernon Moncrieff and John "Jack" Worthing, who are both leading secret double lives. Algernon, a wealthy bachelor who lives in the city, pretends to have a invalid friend named Bunbury whom he visits frequently in the country. Meanwhile, Jack, who lives in the country, pretends to have a younger brother named Ernest who lives in the city and causes him all sorts of trouble.<br><br>The play begins with Algernon visiting Jack's country estate, where he meets Jack's young ward, Cecily. Algernon is immediately smitten with Cecily and decides to adopt the persona of his invented brother, Ernest, in order to woo her. However, things become complicated when Jack's older and more serious-minded friend, Gwendolen Fairfax, arrives on the scene and also falls for "Ernest." Gwendolen is a cousin of Algernon's and has been raised to believe that she will only marry a man named Ernest.<br><br>As the play progresses, it becomes clear that both Algernon and Jack have been leading double lives in order to escape the constraints of Victorian society. Algernon uses his invented friend Bunbury as an excuse to avoid boring social obligations, while Jack uses his invented brother Ernest as a way to escape his dull life in the country. However, their deceptions eventually catch up with them and they are forced to confront the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Throughout the play, Wilde uses humor and satire to criticize the superficiality and hypocrisy of the Victorian upper class. He also explores themes of identity, conformity, and the search for true love. The Importance of Being Earnest is a clever and witty exploration of the complexities of human nature and the social conventions that shape our lives.</p>

He also witnesses the cruelty of human nature, as he encounters greedy and selfish individuals who are willing to do anything to get what they want. Despite all of this, Candide remains optimistic, thanks to Pangloss's teachings.<br><br>However, as he continues on his journey, Candide begins to realize that Pangloss's philosophy is flawed. He witnesses firsthand the suffering and injustice that exist in the world, and comes to the conclusion that human beings are not inherently good, but rather are capable of both good and evil. In the end, Candide renounces his optimism and instead decides to focus on practical solutions to the problems he sees around him.<br><br>Overall, Candide is a biting critique of the philosophy of optimism, and a call for individuals to take responsibility for their own actions and the world around them.

Animal Farm by
  George Orwell
 (1945)
</h3>
<p class="summary-box">Animal Farm is a satirical novella by George Orwell, published in England on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin ("un conte satirique contre Staline"), and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".<br><br>The story is about a group of farm animals who rebel against their human owner, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Initially, the rebellion is a success: the animals complete the harvest and meet every Sunday to debate farm policy. The pigs, who are the most intelligent animals on the farm, become the leaders. However, as time goes on, the pigs begin to assume more power and privilege for themselves, while other animals, particularly the horse Boxer and the pig Squealer, work harder and harder. The pigs start to resemble humans, drinking alcohol and carrying on like the drunken farmer Mr. Jones whom they had overthrown. The other animals, who have been taught to read and write by the pigs, can see the changes but cannot do anything about it. In the end, the pigs become indistinguishable from the humans, and the other animals are left with nothing.<br><br>The book is written as a fable, with animals as the main characters and a clear moral lesson at the end. It uses clever wordplay and imagery to make its points, and its themes are still relevant today, as many people continue to struggle against oppression and inequality. Despite its brevity, Animal Farm is a powerful and thought-provoking book that continues to be read and studied by people all over the world.</p>
